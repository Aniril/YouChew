To do:

icon/logo
reimplement old UI
share on facebook when posting comments (with first picture from foursquare: if possible)
more search options (search for restaurants)
put restaurant page pictures on a separate scroll bar
validation of successful fb login for post of comment (otherwise it doesn't refresh the list after post)
reliant on bug 1: static url for each page based on foursquare id (using graph api, get parsed  comment info for more uses)
on maps, make it so you can click on the marker rather than the image
if we get to adding directions, we can reimplement google maps and use the directions they provide


Bugs:

Bug 1:  can't find http://localhost:1423/Restaurant/Restaurant/@Model.Id callback (it is null)


Changes:

Jason:  Added link to Facebook profile by clicking on your name when logged in.
