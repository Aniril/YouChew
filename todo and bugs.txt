To do:

icon/logo
reimplement old UI
facebook info into static bar (with or without image)
share on facebook when posting comments (with first picture from foursquare: if possible)
more search options (search for restaurants)
put restaurant page pictures on a separate scroll bar
validation of successful fb login for post of comment (otherwise it doesn't refresh the list after post)
reliant on bug 1: static url for each page based on foursquare id (using graph api, get parsed  comment info for more uses)

Bugs:

Bug 1:  can't find http://localhost:1423/Restaurant/Restaurant/@Model.Id callback (it is null)
