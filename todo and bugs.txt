To do:

icon/logo
reimplement old UI
more search options (search for restaurants by name, certain mile radius, etc)
on maps, make it so you can click on the marker rather than the image
if we get to adding directions, we can reimplement google maps and use the directions they provide
also, is there a ranking or rating system that can be imported from foursquare?


Bugs:

When you are at a restaurant page and you click on the YouChew in the upper left, it crashes and burns
