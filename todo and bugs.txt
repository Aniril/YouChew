To do:

if we get to adding directions, we can reimplement google maps and use the directions they provide
also, is there a ranking or rating system that can be imported from foursquare?
user page needs to pull comments made by logged in user.
we need to talk about uploading pictures.

Durel's Thought: Maybe have the home page's search results get submitted to a partial view that appears on the home page.
